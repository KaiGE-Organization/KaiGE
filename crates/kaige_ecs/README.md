- [ ] **Entities, Components, and Systems:**
  - [ ] Define entities as unique identifiers.
  - [ ] Components are data-only structures.
  - [ ] Systems are responsible for updating and processing entities.

- [ ] **Component Composition:**
  - [ ] Support for attaching multiple components to a single entity.

- [ ] **Sparse Set:**
  - [ ] Use a sparse set data structure to efficiently store and query entities.

- [ ] **Query System:**
  - [ ] Allow users to define queries to filter entities based on their components.

- [ ] **Efficient Iteration:**
  - [ ] Provide efficient ways to iterate over entities that match certain criteria.

- [ ] **Event System:**
  - [ ] Support for events and event-driven systems for communication between systems.

- [ ] **Parallel Execution:**
  - [ ] Enable parallel execution of systems to take advantage of multi-core architectures.

- [ ] **Serialization and Deserialization:**
  - [ ] Support for easily serializing and deserializing the ECS state.

- [ ] **Dynamic Component Types:**
  - [ ] Allow for the addition and removal of components at runtime.

- [ ] **Resource Management:**
  - [ ] Manage global resources that can be shared among systems.

- [ ] **Prefab System:**
  - [ ] Ability to define and instantiate prefabs, which are predefined sets of entities and components.

- [ ] **Query Filtering and Sorting:**
  - [ ] Allow users to filter and sort entities based on component data.

- [ ] **Dynamic Queries:**
  - [ ] Support for changing queries dynamically at runtime.

- [ ] **Custom Allocator Support:**
  - [ ] Allow users to specify custom allocators for entity and component storage.

- [ ] **Debugging and Profiling:**
  - [ ] Provide tools for debugging and profiling the ECS, including entity/component inspection and system performance analysis.

- [ ] **Documentation and Community Support:**
  - [ ] Comprehensive documentation.
  - [ ] An active community to help users understand and use the ECS effectively.

- [ ] **Compatibility with Rust's Ownership Model:**
  - [ ] Ensure that the ECS integrates well with Rust's ownership and borrowing system.

- [ ] **Integration with Other Game Systems:**
  - [ ] Smooth integration with other game systems, such as rendering and input.

- [ ] **Lifecycle Management:**
  - [ ] Proper lifecycle management for entities and components, including creation, deletion, and updates.

- [ ] **Versioning and Undo/Redo:**
  - [ ] Support for versioning to facilitate undo/redo functionality in a game editor.
